## General Information
A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
Business objective:
The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion from the analysis
#Inference from the model:
#yr:A coefficient value of 2033.34 indicated that a unit increase in yr variable, increases the bike hire numbers by 2033.34 units.
#temp:A coefficient value of 4975.19  indicated that a unit increase in temp variable, increases the bike hire numbers by 4975.19 units.
#windspeed:A coefficient value of -1279.53  indicated that, a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 1279.53 units.
#season_2::A coefficient value of 708.13 indicated that a unit increase in season_2 variable, increases the bike hire numbers by 708.13 units.
#season_4::A coefficient value of 1099.63 indicated that a unit increase in season_4 variable, increases the bike hire numbers by 1099.63 units.
#mnth_9::A coefficient value of 750.72 indicated that a unit increase in mnth_9 variable, increases the bike hire numbers by 750.72 units.
#weathersit_3::A coefficient value of -2180.08 indicated that, a unit increase in weathersit_3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 2180.08 units.
